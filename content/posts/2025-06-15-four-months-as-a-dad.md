* My mother visited this past week
* My wife went back to work from her maternity leave this week
* Her schedule is week on, week off, and we need to cover three working weeks before we send Daphne to daycare. 
* To bridge the gap, I'm taking two of those weeks off from work while my mother-in-law takes the third. 
* I took this first week; the first time that I've spent so much time with my daughter since returning back to work
* As a bonus, my mother came out from Lansing, MI 
* Seeing my mother with Daphne put them both in a new light. 
* In more ways than one, any light is a new light for Daphne, but I thought I'd seen my mother in just about every light there was. 
* Turns out that she has a different gear. 
* It reminded me of the many different gears I've found in the last four months. 
* This has been the most difficult time in my life, hands down. 
* Not the most emotionally challenging or physically difficult, but the most cumulatively challenging and humbling. 
* Every time my capacity feels tapped, there's a way to squeeze out just a bit more, push a bit harder, and find a way to forge ahead. 
* My dog, Moraine, may have some qualms with that characterization. If I have so much capacity, then why have my miles on the road dropped off precipitously?
* Well, dear dog of mine, it's less about doing eveyrhing that I was doing before, and more about doing less while doing more. 
* In the past four months, I've stopped following current events, sports, or binge watching a TV show, going on two-hour long weekend runs, and traded those luxuries for this new thing in my life - a human with a smile that lights up my house. 
* Hearing the beginnings of a laugh and a series of goos and gahs that hint at the sound of her voice. 
* This is what fills up my days. 
* When she goes to sleep, I push on, trying to keep my mind sharp and engaged so that I can always help support this growing family of mine.
