> Even today, most companies have difficulty finding people who know how to develop products and also understand AI, and I expect this shortage to grow.

This is especially true as modern machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms become more complex. Decision trees are easy to understand. Reinforcement learning is intuitive. Deep learning architectures, on the other hand are obtuse. 

> Increasingly, I also expect strong product managers to be able to build prototypes for themselves. The demand for good AI Product Managers will be huge. In addition to growing AI Product Management as a discipline, perhaps some engineers will also end up doing more product management work.

This is reality. AI in its myriad of forms is here to stay. More and more, I'm thinking of a product team as less of one where each team member plays a specific, defined role and more of one where everyone does similar work but fills slightly different gaps. There are no product managers. There are no engineers. There is only delivering value to people anyway you can. 

Wouldn't that be wonderful?
