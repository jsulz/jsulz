* Most of my professional life revolves around the written word. 
* You'd think I would be better at it by now, but it's still a struggle. 
* Be more direct, more terse, less fluff, 
* Found this post while reading another https://kupajo.com/stamina-is-a-quiet-advantage/

> By knowing how to parse and convey the right information, a good writer can relieve and prevent a slew of headaches. They can herd disjointed efforts, give direction to projects, sell ideas, solidify shared purpose, document processes, and foster knowledge sharing.

* Writing is challenging because it's an attempt to cohere the incoherent. 
* One that you're never sure is actually good enough; does it convey the point you're trying to make? Is it grounded in truth?

> Writing is far from an isolated skill. Rather, it’s a non-linear process of gathering, curating, organizing, creating, and refining ideas and information. Like a factory in which the assembly line loops back on itself until you decide the newest assembly, that one last iteration, is good enough.

* Will it be read? Does it matter if it isn't?

>“Writing a report is important; reading it often is not. Reports are more a medium of self-discipline than a way to communicate information.”
