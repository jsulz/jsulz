This is my personal blog!

A few things to note: 
1. This is just a fun place for me to write when I get the chance. If you're not into artificial intelligence, distributed applications, web development, or random philosophical musings on product management, this probably isn't your cup of tea.
2. I don't write a lot.
3. I want to write more.
4. Sometimes I write about bread.
